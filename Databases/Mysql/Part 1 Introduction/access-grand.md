The error `ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd'@'%' to database 'gavin'` in MySQL occurs because the specified user does not have the required privileges to access the database `gavin`. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Steps to Resolve:**

#### 1. **Verify the Current Privileges**

Log in as the MySQL root user or an admin user with sufficient privileges and check the user's current privileges:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd'@'%';
```

#### 2. **Grant Necessary Privileges**

If the user lacks the required privileges, grant them access to the `gavin` database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gavin.* TO 'user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd'@'%';
```

or, if more restrictive permissions are needed:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON gavin.* TO 'user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd'@'%';
```

#### 3. **Apply Privilege Changes**

After granting privileges, run the following command to apply changes:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### 4. **Check the Database Existence**

Ensure the database `gavin` exists. You can verify this with:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'gavin';
```

If it does not exist, you need to create it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE gavin;
```

#### 5. **Verify Connection Details**

Double-check the user's host ('@`%`') and password. If the credentials are incorrect, reset the password:

```sql
ALTER USER 'user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### 6. **Test the Connection**

Try reconnecting to the database using the user's credentials to ensure the problem is resolved:

```bash
mysql -u user_4352mst3n_4359umdpd -p -h <hostname> gavin
```

### **Common Pitfalls:**

- **Host Mismatch:** If the user is defined with a specific host (e.g., `localhost` or an IP address) rather than `%`, the connection might fail. Update the host part in the GRANT statement if necessary.
- **Insufficient Root Access:** Ensure the root user or admin user you’re using has the `GRANT OPTION` privilege to modify other users' privileges.

- **Database Ownership Issues:** If the database was created by another user, the current user may not have ownership or access rights.
