# Aggregation-Notes

1. TO WRITE AGGREGATE QUERY
2. A PIPELINE OPERATION

IT GROUP THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS INTO A SINGLE DOCUMENT BASED ON SPECIFIED EXPRESSION

## Aggregation Pipeline

- The aggregation process in mongodb consists of several stages , each stage transforming the data in some way.
- The output of one stage is fed as the input to the next stage and so on until the final stage produces the desired result

```markdown
### Key Concepts
1. **Pipeline**: A sequence of stages where each stage transforms the data.
2. **Stages**: Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data.
3. **Operators**: MongoDB provides various operators like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$project`, etc.

```

```jsx
db.collection.aggregate(pipeline , options)
```

```markdown
### Common Aggregation Stages
- **$match**: Filters documents to pass only those that match the specified condition.
- **$group**: Groups documents by a specified field and can perform operations like sum, average, etc.
- **$sort**: Sorts the documents based on a specified field.
- **$project**: Reshapes each document in the stream, such as by adding or removing fields.
```

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$match:{gender:"Male"}}])

//Return all the
```

```jsx
db.teachers.insertMany([
{ _id: 1, name: "Arun Sharma", age: 45, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 2, name: "Meena Gupta", age: 39, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 3, name: "Rajesh Kumar", age: 50, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 4, name: "Anjali Verma", age: 42, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 5, name: "Suresh Patil", age: 36, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 6, name: "Pooja Rani", age: 29, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 7, name: "Vikram Singh", age: 33, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 8, name: "Kavita Das", age: 40, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 9, name: "Amit Trivedi", age: 47, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 10, name: "Nisha Jain", age: 35, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 11, name: "Rakesh Bhardwaj", age: 38, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 12, name: "Smita Bansal", age: 31, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 13, name: "Harish Chand", age: 49, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 14, name: "Swati Mehta", age: 28, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 15, name: "Deepak Joshi", age: 37, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 16, name: "Sunita Sharma", age: 41, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 17, name: "Ashok Singh", age: 44, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 18, name: "Priya Kapoor", age: 34, gender: "Female" },
{ _id: 19, name: "Manoj Deshmukh", age: 48, gender: "Male" },
{ _id: 20, name: "Ritu Agarwal", age: 30, gender: "Female" }
]);
```

# Group Teachers by age

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age"}}])
```

the `$group` operator groups documents by the age field , creating a new documents for each unique age value

the _id field in the group stage specifies the field based on which the documents will be grouped 

## Group teacher by age and show all teachers names per age group

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age" , names:{$push:"$name"}}}])
```

```jsx
$group:{_id:expression,field1:expression , field2:expression , ...}
```

this Teachernames field uses the $push operator to add the name fields from each document in the group to an array

## Group teachers by age and also show complete documents per age group

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age" , students:{$push:"$$ROOT"}}}])
```

## Give a count per age of male teacher

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$match:{gender:"Male"}},{$group:{_id:"$age" , number:{$sum:1}}}])
```

![Frame 17.png](Aggregation-Notes%20260f406ae1a48067915cc45dd6144cfa/Frame_17.png)

## Give a count per age of male students and sort them by count in desc manner

```jsx
db.teachers.aggregate([{$match:{gender:"Male"}},{$group:{_id:"$age" , number:{$sum:1}}} , {$sort:{number:-1}}])
```

We can create pipeline as much as we want

## Find Hobbies per age group

```jsx
db.students.insertMany([

}
]);
```

```jsx
db.students.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$age" , hobbies:{$push:"$hobbies"}}}])
```

# $unwind

```jsx
 db.students.aggregate([{$unwind:"$hobbies"},{$group:{_id:"$age" , hobbies:{$push:"$hobbies"}}}])
```

## Find number of students per each hobbies

```jsx
 db.students.aggregate([{$unwind:"$hobbies"},{$group:{_id:"$hobbies" , count:{$sum:1}}}])
```

# Find Average age of all students

```jsx
 db.students.aggregate([{$group:{_id:null , averageAge:{$avg:"$age"}}}])
```

if you specify _id:null in the $group operator , it means that all the documents in the collection will be grouped together into a single group

# Find the total number of hobbies for all the students in a collection

```jsx
db.students.aggregate([{$unwind:"$hobbies"},{$group:{_id:null , count:{$sum:1}}}])
```

### second way

```jsx
db.students.aggregate([{$group:{_id:null , count:{$sum:{$size:"$hobbies"}}}}])
```

### third way

```jsx
 db.students.aggregate([
...   {
...     $addFields: {
...       hobbiesCount: { $size: { $ifNull: ["$hobbies", []] } }
...     }
...   },
...   {
...     $group: {
...       _id: null,
...       count: { $sum: "$hobbiesCount" }
...     }
...   }
... ]);
```

# List all hobbies

```jsx
db.students.aggregate([{$unwind:"$hobbies"},{$group:{_id:null , allHabit:{$push:"$hobbies"}}}])
```

## $addToSet

```jsx
db.students.aggregate([{$unwind:"$hobbies"},{$group:{_id:null , allHabit:{$addToSet:"$hobbies"}}}])
```

# $FILTER

```jsx
$filter:{
input:<array Expression>,
as:<identifier>,
cond:<expression>
}
```

`Input` : **Specifies the array expression to filter**

**`as`: Specifies a variable name that can be used inside the condition expression to reference the current element of the input array.**

**`condition`: Specifies the condition that must be met in order for an element to be included in the result set. The Expression must return either `true` or `false`.**

```jsx
db.studentMarks.insertMany([
  {

  },

    name: "Ananya Sharma", 
    age: 19, 
    scores: [78, 85, 90, 72, 80]  y
  },

[x,x,x,y] = 

```

## Find average of scores for students whose age is greater than 20.

```jsx
db.studentMarks.aggregate([
  {
    $addFields: {
      filteredScores: {
        $filter: {
          input: "$scores",
          as: "score",
          cond: { $gt: ["$age", 20] } // Filter logic here
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avgScore: { $avg: { $avg: "$filteredScores" } }
    }
  }
]);
